We are a multidisciplinary team of researchers with backgrounds in microbial waste management, molecular ecology, and microbial community analysis. Our work on the black soldier fly (*Hermetia illucens*, Diptera: Stratiomyidae) started in 2014 with a first project focussing on improving small-scale rearing and investigating microbe-host relationships. Over time, our collaborations also expanded to other disciplines, covering socio-economical aspects and citizen science.

The key areas of our work involve the investigation of interkingdom relationships between microbes and flies as well as the challenges arising with the industrial up-scaling of black soldier fly rearing.
