### Coffee breaks & lunch

Coffee breaks will be held in the foyer on the ground floor. On Friday, we will take a short (5-minute) walk together to the [UNI Lounge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VUE7hL6vAiNGGwK18) canteen in a nearby building for lunch. You can view the menu [here](https://lfuonline.uibk.ac.at/de/universitaet/essen-am-campus/uni-lounge/). While coffee and snacks during the breaks are provided by the meeting organizers, lunch expenses must be covered individually using the daily allowance.

### Social Dinner

The social dinner will take place on Friday, 29 August, starting at 19:30 at [Gasthof Bierstindl](https://www.bierstindl.eu/). Dinner expenses must be covered individually using the daily allowance.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; background-color:#FFD6D6">If you plan to attend the social dinner, please register \[**HERE**\] until **August 1st** to allow us to make the required reservations.</p>

### Posters

To foster collaboration and identify shared research interests among COST Action members, we invite you to prepare a poster (**A0 vertical format**) introducing your working group or lab and summarizing your general research focus. The poster sessions are meant as an opportunity to familiarize participants with each other's research groups rather than to present recent findings.
