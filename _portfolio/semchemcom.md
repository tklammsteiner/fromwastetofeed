The black soldier fly (*Hermetia illucens*) holds significant biotechnological potential, drawing increasing scientific attention due to its ability to address two critical challenges of the current century. Firstly, it offers a solution to the escalating global issue of managing organic waste in an economically and ecologically sustainable manner. Secondly, it presents a promising resource for meeting the food and feed demands of a growing population with rising living standards, particularly in economically poorer countries.

The larvae of the black soldier fly exhibit remarkable versatility, capable of efficiently utilizing various organic waste streams, ranging from plant residues to slaughterhouse waste. Furthermore, these larvae serve as a nutritious feed source for farm animals such as poultry, pigs, and fish, boasting high levels of fat and protein, along with mineral richness. However, the fragility of adult flies in their reproductive stage poses a significant bottleneck to the overall process.

To overcome this challenge, a project has been initiated with the objective of identifying chemicals produced by microorganisms that positively influence the egg-laying behavior of the black soldier fly. The research integrates egg-laying experiments with a multidisciplinary approach encompassing chemical, microbiological, genetic, and genomic analyses. The ultimate goal is to select an optimal substrate for oviposition, identify the chemical substances promoting oviposition, and characterize the microorganisms responsible. The success of this project could have both applied and basic science implications, leading to the development of new, industrially relevant breeding methods and offering insights into the chemical communication of insects and microorganisms with behavioral consequences.
