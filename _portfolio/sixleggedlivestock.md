The FWF - Top Citizen Science project "Six-legged Livestock: Rearing Black Soldier Fly on Biowaste" aims to complement the existing FWF project "From Waste to Feed: Waste products as a source of protein-rich feedstuff." The ongoing FWF project focuses on evaluating and optimizing the production of animal feedstuff in the form of *Hermetia illucens* prepupae, utilizing various organic waste sources. However, the limitation lies in the reliance on single and defined diets tested in laboratory experiments, excluding mixed diets like domestic biowaste, which varies based on consumer eating habits, season, and region.

To address this gap, the Citizen Science project engages citizens, not typically involved in scientific work, to conduct feeding experiments with black soldier fly larvae in their homes. Participants use feeding container boxes they construct from scratch to process their daily domestic biowaste. This approach allows for a diverse range of experiments with different diets and associated biowastes, leveraging the variability inherent in source-separated collected biowaste.

The involvement of citizens in this project not only contributes valuable data but also aims to challenge and overcome public prejudices against insect-based feed. By fostering direct interaction with edible insects, the project aims to increase public acceptance of insect-based fish and chicken feed. Additionally, this Citizen Science initiative seeks to break down existing barriers between science and society, creating an alliance that generates knowledge beyond what science could achieve in isolation. The collaborative efforts of researchers, experts, and citizen participants in rearing Black Soldier Fly larvae on biowaste contribute to a holistic understanding of sustainable waste management and innovative protein production for animal feed.
