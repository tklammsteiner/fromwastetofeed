The growing challenges posed by increasing human population, urban expansion, and a throw-away-society economy have made effective waste management a critical issue. In this context, recycling and processing biodegradable materials, including organic waste, wastewater, and renewable resources, present a viable solution to mitigate environmental and climate impacts. Currently, various methods such as incineration, landfill disposal, anaerobic digestion, and composting are employed for biodegradable waste management.

From a thermodynamic perspective, there is an opportunity to utilize organic wastes containing valuable bio-molecules at a higher energy level. The ideal process would require no energy, chemicals, or water, be self-contained, emit minimal effluent and greenhouse gases, operate with simplicity, have no moving parts, and necessitate little maintenance. This bioconversion process envisions utilizing the larvae of the black soldier fly (BSF), *Hermetia illucens*, as a key component.

The BSF-driven bioconversion process aims to be a fast, clean, efficient, and economical method for recycling various types of organic agricultural waste. The project focuses on characterizing and comparing different organic waste resources, adapting process conditions to the life history of BSF, analyzing the chemical-physical properties of the obtained larvae for their suitability as animal feed, identifying the larval digestive tract microbiota, and conducting hygiene screening and pathogen monitoring. The utilization of BSF larvae in waste management demonstrates a creative and sustainable approach to address the pressing issue of effective and environmentally friendly waste disposal.
