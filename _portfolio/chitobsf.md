In addition to providing a nutrient source for traditional livestock, this project focuses on an additional valuable process step – the production of highly active biopolymer chitosan. Chitosan, a derivative of chitin, holds significant industrial potential in agriculture, wastewater treatment, sanitation, and pharmaceuticals. The goal is to establish sustainable chitosan production from insect-based resources, alongside high-quality proteins, lipids, and fertilizers, by enhancing technological expertise at our industry partner.

Leveraging LIVIN farms' biomass separation process, the defatted and deproteinized larval biomass pulp will be processed to recover high-quality protein and chitin suitable for the food industry. The residual biomass will undergo various chemical or enzymatically assisted extraction protocols to obtain chitin and chitosan fractions. Screening for highly specific enzymes, particularly those active on BSF materials, will be conducted using RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis. The quality of the products will be assessed through established bioassays, evaluating biocidal efficacy on various bacteria and fungi. Overall, the project aims to contribute to sustainable waste valorization and reduce reliance on unsustainable, imported feeds, aligning with the EU Commission's goals and the Green Deal's objectives.
